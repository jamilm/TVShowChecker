# TVShowChecker
A website that will allow you to check when the next new episode of a TV show will air.
The user must simply type in the name of the TV show and the screen will either turn green and say a new episode is on tonight, turn yellow and give the date of the next episode, or turn red and say the TV show is off air. 
The code lies mostly within index.php and functions.php
